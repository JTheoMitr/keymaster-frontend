'Klimakes' React Portfolio Project
This application acts as the front end portion of my React Portfolio Project.

Usage
To begin, you will first need to open up the backend repository here: https://github.com/JTheoMitr/klimakes-backend

To seed some preliminary information into the database, enter the following into your terminal:

rails db:seed

Run the rails server by entering the following in your terminal:

rails s -p 3001

once the server is running, open this repo, and enter the following in your terminal:

yarn install

followed by:

yarn start

From there you will use the app in your default browser.

Once finished - remember to exit both the front end and the rails server in your terminal (ctrl + c) before closing out your development environment(s)!
